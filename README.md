# Data-Mining
I have created a  Movie Recommender System using different algorithms and have separated them in 3 diff files.
Movie Recommender system is content based and collaborative based and then it is based on user user similarity matrix and item item similarity matrix which I have tried to work upon.
I have used the Movie lens 27 M dataset for this task and since it was an unsupervised learning algorithm I was unable to predict the accuracy of my models.
However, while using Knn I tried to play with different values of K and the optimum value was 5 for me which is also the default.
While using K-NN and collabarotive filtering I tried using Cosine distance as a matrix.
I didn't try to use different hyperparameters of nearest neighbours which can be used to increase the prediction and decrease the cosine distance. Other distances can also be used to check the differences in the distances.
